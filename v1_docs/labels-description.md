- `Category: Damage`
This category includes labels which describe objects, both natural and manmade, whose form or function have been impaired due to impact, erosion, water, fire, or other forces. Note that some objects may be described by multiple labels; in that case, the priority should go to the label further down on the list. For example, a landslide may also be rubble/debris; however, you should label it as landslide, since it is further down on the list.
    - `Label: damage (misc)`
Generic label for miscellaneous damage. Objects should be labeled with this label if they clearly show damage, but are not described by any of the other labels.
    - `Label: rubble/debris`
This label should be used to label collections of fragmented materials, such as stone, metal, wood, concrete, asphalt, dirt, glass, plastic, or trash. 
    - `Label: landslide`
This label should be used to indicate the areas affected when a large mass of earth or stone becomes dislocated and slides down a hill, mountain, or cliff. 
    - `Label: flooding/water damage`
This label should be used to indicate damage caused by water or flooding, such as submerged vehicles, farmland, buildings, or infrastructure.
    - `Label: road-washout`
This label should be used for a specific instance of water damage, where roads or their foundations have been eroded by water, causing them to collapse or become otherwise unpassable.
    - `Label: smoke/fire`
This label should be used to indicate the presence of smoke or fire damage, such as from forest fires, explosions, lava flows, or building fires.
- `Category: Environment`
This category includes labels that describe the natural environment, including natural materials and vegetation.
    - `Label: dirt`
This label should be used to indicate ground areas that are composed of dirt.
    - `Label: grass`
This label should be used to indicate ground areas that are covered in grasses or other short groundcover, such as wildflowers.
    - `Label: lava`
This label should be used to indicate molten or (recently) flowing lava. Molten lava may appear red or orange in places, and will often be surrounded by smoke, steam, fires, and ashes. 
    - `Label: rocks/rocky terrain`
This label should be used to indicate regions that are comprised primarily of rocks or stone, such as mountains, boulders, and cliffs.
    - `Label: sand`
This label should be used to indicate regions that are comprised primarily of sand, such as beaches, deserts, and dunes.
    - `Label: shrubs`
This label should be used to indicate regions that are covered in medium-height (~2-5 ft., ~0.5-1.5 m) vegetation, such as bushes, stalks, and shrubs.
    - `Label: snow/ice`
This label should be used to indicate regions and objects covered in snow or ice, such as snow-covered vegetation or buildings, glaciers, icebergs, and frozen bodies of water. 
    - `Label: trees`
This label should be used to indicate individual trees, as well as regions covered in tall (greater than 5 ft or 1.5m) vegetation.
- `Category: Infrastructure`
This category includes manmade structures and environments
    - `Label: bridge`
This label should be used to indicate structures constructed to permit passage over an obstacle, such as water, valley, or a road.
    - `Label: building`
This label should be used to indicate any structures meant to enclose people or property, such as houses, office buildings, factories, hangars, sheds, and garages.
    - `Label: dam/levee`
This label should be used to indicate structures meant to restrict or control the flow of water. These can appear as walls or ridges of earth near a body of water to prevent overflow.
    - `Label: pipe`
This label should be used to indicate infrastructure meant to carry liquids or gases, such as water, sewage, oil, or natural gas, between locations.
    - `Label: railway`
This label should be used to indicate infrastructure meant to carry trains and related forms of transport, including streetcars, subways, and light and heavy rail.
    - `Label: road`
This label should be used to indicate infrastructure meant to carry wheeled transports, such as cars, trucks, and bicycles, or pedestrians. This can include roads made with gravel, dirt, concrete, asphalt, and other building materials.
    - `Label: tower-electric/Power lines/Utility lines`
This label should be used to indicate infrastructure meant to transmit and distribute utilities through wires (electricity/cable/phone), such as towers, wires, transformers, and other related components.
    - `Label: tower-communications`
This label should be used to indicate infrastructure meant to facilitate wireless communications, including radio and cellular towers, satellite dishes, and other related components.
    - `Label: tower-water`
This label should be used to indicate towers for storing and distributing water. 
- `Category: Vehicles`
This category includes labels for manmade objects designed to transport people and materials.
    - `Label: aircraft`
This label should be used to indicate vehicles that are designed to fly through the air, such as airplanes, jets, gliders, helicopters, and rotorcraft.
    - `Label: boat`
This label should be used to indicate vehicles designed to traverse water, such as canoes, kayaks, rafts, ships, rowboats, motorboats, and yachts.
    - `Label: car`
This label should be used to indicate small-to-medium, generally consumer automotive vehicles, such as sedans, SUVs, minivans, coupes, and pickup trucks.
    - `Label: truck`
This label should be used to indicate medium-to-large, generally commercial automotive vehicles, such as tractor-trailers, utility vehicles, delivery trucks, or construction vehicles.
- `Category: Water`
This category contains labels to describe bodies of water
    - `Label: flooding`
This label should be used to indicate the presence of large quantities of standing or moving water where there typically is not water, and this water has impaired the form or function of some object. This includes flooding of both manmade and natural environments, such as flooded roads, towns, and forests. 
    - `Label: lake/pond`
This label should be used to indicate permanent, enclosed bodies of water—i.e. there should be land on all sides of the body of water. These can be naturally occurring or manmade.
    - `Label: ocean`
This label should be used to indicate large, permanent, open bodies of water—i.e. it is not enclosed entirely by land
    - `Label: puddle`
This label should be used to indicate small, temporary bodies of water which do not cause damage. 
    - `Label: river`
This label should be used to indicate streams of flowing water.
